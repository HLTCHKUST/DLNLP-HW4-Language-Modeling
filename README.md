# DLNLP-HW4-Language-Modeling
HW4 of Course ELEC 4230 Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing

The goal of this assignment is to perform Language Modeling based on Recurrent Neural Network model.
You first need to load and clean and analyze the data, i.e., extract the words and their corresponding
embedding. Furthermore, implement many-to-many and many-to-one word prediction model based on
a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model using PyTorch.
For this assignment, we are going to use a The Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge
Dataset from Sherlock Holmes
novels. We already provide a subsets of the original challenge, however if your machine is not powerful
enough you can further reduce the number of file. In case you do so, please report the files name used
for the training.
